# JamHacks 9 Project
## Flood Simulation

This project was created for JamHacks 9. It simulates flooding scenarios to help visualize and analyze flood risks.

### Features

- Interactive flood simulation
- Visualization of water flow and accumulation
- Adjustable parameters for rainfall, terrain, and barriers

### APIs Used

- **OpenWeatherMap API** – For real-time and historical weather data
- **Mapbox API** – For map rendering and terrain visualization

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JamHacks9_Flood_Simulation.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the simulation:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Folder Structure

- `main.py` - Entry point for the simulation
- `simulation/` - Core simulation logic
- `visualization/` - Code for rendering and UI
- `data/` - Sample terrain and rainfall data
- `README.md` - Project documentation

### Usage

Adjust simulation parameters in the UI or configuration files to explore different flooding scenarios.
